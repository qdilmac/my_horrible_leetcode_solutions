<h1>Oonga Bunga Coding Practice</h1>

- As you can tell from my horrible leetcode solutions I just got into leetcode problems. I'm currently using python to solve them
and maybe switch to c++ or use in conjunction

- I always coded for robotics projects or some silly little things to improve myself but never properly followed a problem set so here
we are I guess
